# Mink Facebook WebDriver extension

[![CI](https://github.com/silverstripe/MinkFacebookWebDriver/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/silverstripe/MinkFacebookWebDriver/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Currently forked from [https://github.com/minkphp/MinkSelenium2Driver/] and updated to use
the [facebook php webdriver](https://github.com/facebook/php-webdriver).

See [https://github.com/minkphp/MinkSelenium2Driver/issues/254] for the status of selenium 3 support.

Major updates include:

 - Switch to using facebook/webdriver
 - Selenium optional, can use chromedriver (or other jsonwire protocol servers instead)
 - Default to `chrome` instead of `firefox`
 - Update minimum php version to 5.6

## Using the Facebook WebDriver with behat

Subclass `Behat\MinkExtension\ServiceContainer\MinkExtension` and add the new driver factory.

```php
<?php

namespace SilverStripe\BehatExtension;

use Behat\MinkExtension\ServiceContainer\MinkExtension as BaseMinkExtension;
use SilverStripe\MinkFacebookWebDriver\FacebookFactory;

class MinkExtension extends BaseMinkExtension
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
        $this->registerDriverFactory(new FacebookFactory());
    }
}
```

Add this extension to your `behat.yml` (see below)
 
## Running chromedriver instead of selenium

Make sure you install chromedriver and have the service running

```
$ brew install chromedriver
$ chromedriver
Starting ChromeDriver 2.34.522932 (4140ab217e1ca1bec0c4b4d1b148f3361eb3a03e) on port 9515
Only local connections are allowed.
```

Set the wb_host to this server instead (substitute `SilverStripe\BehatExtension\MinkExtension`
for your class).

```
